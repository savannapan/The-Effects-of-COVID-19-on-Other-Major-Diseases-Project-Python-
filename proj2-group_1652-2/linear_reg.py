""" CSC110 Fall 2021 Final Project: Simple Linear Regression

Module Description
==================
This Python file implements a simple linear regression algorithm in order to investigate the
relationship between the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and the death counts for three major
diseases in Ontario, the values of which are given by an imported dataset. This file will calculate
the regression line which best describes the data.

    The equation of a line is given by y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

    The regression line is calculated using the method of least squares, where the slope, m, and
    the y-intercept, b, are calculated using the following formulas:

    m = sum((x_0 - mean(x)) * (y_0 - mean(y))) / sum((x_0 - mean(x))^2)

    b = mean(y) - (m * mean(x))

        where x_0 is the values of the x-variable, y_0 is the values of the y-variable, mean(x) is
        the mean of all x-values, and mean(y) is the mean of all y_values.

    The hospitalization values will be considered as the x-values and the death counts as the
    y-values.
